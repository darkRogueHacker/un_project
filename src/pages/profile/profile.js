              My journey as a Security Information Analyst with United Nations
              Department for Safety and Security (UNDSS) started in May 2010,
              and has certainly been a very interesting and enriching one with
              lots to learn, experience, receive, and give in three different
              countries and regions. I had a background in research and analysis
              in the public and private sector including the CIA before I joined
              UNDSS, which included working for a think tank under the Indian
              Defense Ministry in New Delhi, where I specialized in
              counterterrorism policies and conflict management/resolution,
              private risk consultancies such as Hill and Associates, and
              International SOS in South Asia, and research institutes such as
              the Institute for Counter Terrorism in Israel. I was asked to join
              UNDSS for the newly created position of security analyst in late
              2009. My first assignment for UNDSS was in Philippines , where I
              spent seven years covering the region and filled in as the Field
              Security Coordination Officer (FSCO) for Mindanao and acting
              Deputy Security Advisor (DSA) in their absence.
